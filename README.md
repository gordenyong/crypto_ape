# Crypto Ape 
This project allows users to search for their favourite cryptocurrencies or even add them into their watchlist. Cryptocurrency data like market cap, price, volume will be shown when its searched in the search bar. However, the user must log in in order to add the specific coin into their watchlist. Also, if the user decided not to sign up/ log in, they are also allowed to use the search function to search for their cryptocurrencies. [Crypto Ape App](https://ruby-crypto-scanner.herokuapp.com/)

## My plan/ approach
### 1. Wireframing
The Crypto Ape App has 4 different pages, the home page where users can search information about their favourite cryptocurrencies,login & sign-up page, and the display information page where it shows the information about the cryptocurrency the user searched. 

### 2. Backend development
The backend development involved the following steps:
    1. Database creation and population using schema
    2. User sign up and sign in
    3. API integration. API used to get cryptocurrency data: [Coincap API](https://docs.coincap.io/)
    4. Watchlist: CRUD (where users can edit the image for every cryptocurrency added to their watchlist)

### 3. Frontend development
The front end development involved the following steps:
    1. HTML Structure for all pages
    2. Display data from API 
    3. CSS
